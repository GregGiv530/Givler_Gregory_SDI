//Alert box- pop up boc that will alert the user with information.

//Console.log - Shows information to the programmer
// Great for checking values and debugging.
// Also shows all error

//Declare a variable
//Use the keyword of var
var whatever1;

//Define the variable
//Sets the value of the existing variable
whatever1 = 42;

//Console.log the variable
console.log("The variable whatever1 is");

//Declare and define a variable at the same time.

//Define this variable using an existing variable

//Find our ages

//Declare and Define the year we were born

//Assignment Operators
/*
= Assigns the value to the variable
++ Adds 1 to the current value of the variable
-- Subtracts 1 from the current of the variable
+= # Adds the number to the current value of the variable
-= # Subracts the number of the current value of the variable
/= # Divide the number of the current value of the variable
*= # Multiply the number of the current value of the variable
 */

var assign = 0;

//++ is the same as assign=assign+1;

//-- is the same as assign = assign-1;
assign--;

// += # is the same as assign = assign+#;
assign+=5; // assign = assign+5;
console.log(assign);

//-= # is the same as assign = assign-#;
assign-=2;
console.log(assign);

// /= is the same as assign = assign/#;
assign/=3;
console.log(assign);

// *= is the same as assign = assign*#;

console.log(assign);

//String - any text that we use
//Quotes are needed to distinguish between variables and plain text

var kermit = "light green";
var frogName = "kermit";
console.log(frogName);

//To double quote or not to double
//Can use an escape character \ backslash in front of the '
var phrase = 'I don\'t know';
console.log(phrase);

// Escape character can also do multiple lines \n - new line character
var phrase2 = "I don't know. \nYou never do!";
console.log(phrase2);

//Boolean - Kind of like a light switch.
//Either true or false
//Not a Text String and must be lowercase!!
var yes = true;

var no = false;

//Order of Operations
// PEMDAS - Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.
//Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction

//Find the average quiz grade
var quiz1 = 87;
var quiz2 = 100;
var quiz3 = 90;

//Average - Add them up and divide by the number of quizes
var average = (quiz1+quiz2+quiz3)/3;
console.log(average);

//Concatenation - Combining text strings
// Use the + plus sign - add and concatanation

var firstName = "Kermit";
var lastName = "The Frog";
var fullName = firstName +" "+ lastName;
console.log(fullName);

var d = 6;
var e = "7";
//If you want the text string to be a number you have to cast it.
//Number(the text string)

//To round a number we use .toFixed(#)
